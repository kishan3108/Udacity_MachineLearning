# Udacity_MachineLearning

This is my project work for Udacity's 'Intro To Machine Learning' Class. I think the class is really great. 

You can find every project in this repository. I am highly advice you to use this just as a reference.

I've also attached Final Project and my write-up. I hope this will help.
